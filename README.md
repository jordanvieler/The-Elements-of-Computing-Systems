# The Elements of Computing-Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken
## AKA: [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

To gain a first principles understanding about how computers fundementally work, I have been working through this book and completing the accompanying projects.

Thus far, I have:
1. [Built basic logic gates from NAND primitives](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/tree/main/Boolean_Logic)
2. [implemented an ALU](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/tree/main/Boolean_Arithmetic)
3. [Constructed RAM16K and a PC from D Flip Flop Primitives](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/tree/main/Sequential_Logic)
4. [Constructed CPU and Memory Chips and integrated them into the HACK computer platform](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/tree/main/Computer_Architecture)
5. [Implemented multiplication and I/O routines in the HACK machine language](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/tree/main/Machine_Language)

***All from primitive NAND gates and D Flip Flops!***

This repo serves as an archive of these completed projects.
