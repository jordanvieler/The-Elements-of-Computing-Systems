# The Elements of Computing-Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken
## AKA: [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

To gain a first principles understanding about how computers fundementally work, I have been working through this book and completing the accompanying projects.

Thus far, I have:
1. Completed the HACK computer platfrom in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
   - Built basic logic gates from NAND primitives
   - implemented an ALU
   - Constructed RAM16K and a PC from D Flip Flop Primitives
   - Constructed a CPU and Memory Chips
   - Integrated CPU, Memory and ROM into a Computer
2. Implemented multiplication and I/O routines in the HACK machine language

***All from primitive NAND gates and D Flip Flops!***

This repo serves as an archive of these completed projects.
