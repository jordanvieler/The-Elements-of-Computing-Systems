# The Elements of Computing-Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken
##AKA: [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

To gain a first principles understanding about how computers fundementally work, I have been working through this book and completing the accompanying projects.
Thus far, I have:
*Completed the HACK computer platfrom in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
	*Built basic logic gates from NAND primitives
	*Implemented an ALU
	*Constructed RAM16K and a PC from D-Flip-Flop Primitives
	*Constructed a CPU and Memory Chips
	*Integrated CPU, Memory and ROM into a Computer
*Implemented multiplication and I/O routines in the HACK machine language

This repo serves as an archive of my learning experiences from completing these projects
