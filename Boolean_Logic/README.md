# Boolean Logic
In this porject, I implemented the logic gates Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux, Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8way, Mux4Way, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, and DMux8Way, in 
Hardware Description Language, from NAND gate primitives. Shown below are diagrams of the circuits I constructed. A gate besides NAND is used in the circuit as an 
abstraction of it's prior implementation in NAND.

## Key Takeaway:
Complex behavior can be built up from primitive building blocks. Any Boolean function, no matter how complex, can be implementended from a combination of And, Not, 
and Or given by it's canonical representation. In turn And, Not, and Or can be implemented trivially using NAND primitives.
