# Machine Language
In this project I implemented routines to [multiply](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/blob/main/Machine_Language/Mult.asm) two integers and an [I/O](https://github.com/jordanvieler/The_Elements_of_Computing_Systems/blob/main/Machine_Language/Fill.asm) routine in assembly language for the HACK computer. The assembly language .asm files were converted to binary .hack machine language files to be ran on the HACK computer.

**For the I/O routine:** screen pixels are activated from left to right and down across the screen in sequential order when any keyboard key is held. When the key is released, the pixels are deactivated in reverese from the last pixel to be activated
